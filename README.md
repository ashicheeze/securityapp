# securityapp

Prototype application demonstrating how a store can record purchases tied to a
user account via QR codes. Users present a QR code generated by the app which
encodes their account ID. The store scans the code and sends a purchase record
using the provided API.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- `flask` and `qrcode` Python packages

## Running
1. Install dependencies (requires internet access):
   ```bash
   pip install flask qrcode[pil]
   ```
2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   python -m securityapp.app
   ```
3. Generate a QR code for a user:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5000/qr/alice
   ```
4. Record a purchase by POSTing scanned data:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/purchase -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        -d '{"user_id": "alice", "item": "example_item"}'
   ```

Purchase history is stored in `purchases.json` in the current directory.
