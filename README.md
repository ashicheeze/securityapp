This repository contains a simple example of displaying a QR code
associated with a Nintendo account inside an application. The QR code
provided here is only a **placeholder** and does not encode real account
data.

## How to run the example

1. Ensure you have a web browser available.
2. Open `app/index.html` in the browser.
3. The page will show a placeholder QR code that mimics the appearance of
   a Nintendo account QR code.

Actual QR code generation based on Nintendo account information is not
implemented in this repository.
